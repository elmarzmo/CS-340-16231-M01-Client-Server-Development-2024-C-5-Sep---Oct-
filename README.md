How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Considering the work we did in the CRUD Python module, we can write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code by breaking it into distinct functions and modules, each handling a specific task, and by choosing meaningful variable and function names (e.g., Create for the creation operation). 
The CRUD Python module we created is reusable because it encapsulates database operations in functions, allowing us to easily integrate it into new projects without needing to rewrite it."



How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

In computer science, we need to approach problems methodically by breaking them down into small, manageable tasks. We start by understanding the requirements, which involves analyzing and gathering all available information. In the Grazioso Salvare dashboard project, we focused on understanding the design of the database and how to connect it to our code. We also worked on the authentication aspect to prevent unauthorized access to the database, and then we designed and implemented the visualization.

The approach we used in this project would differ from other projects based on the client's requirements and the tools needed. For future projects, techniques and strategies such as Agile methodology practices, including iterative development and continuous feedback, would be key areas of focus.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists solve problems using computational thinking, designing algorithms, and developing software systems that create technology solutions for various aspects of our lives. 
Their work matters because it makes our lives easier by automating tasks, improving processes, and providing efficient solutions to complex problems.

The project we worked on helped Grazioso Salvare by allowing them to analyze their data and retrieve valuable information easily. It also reduced the time that would have been spent manually analyzing data, making their operations more efficient and effective.
